# Battleship-Game
Java Object Oriented Programming - COP3330 - Battleship Game

This program was a semester long project for COP 3330, Object Oriented Programming at UCF.
The game allows for multiple game options. The user can play against the computer or another player.
Select game options and colors desired to use for ships, then place ships.
Once all ships have been placed then select the deploy button and PLAY!

First player to sink all (5) ships of the opposing player first wins!

GOOD LUCK!
